# CPPND: Capstone Project

## Overview: Shooting Game in C++ with SDL

This is repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) repo and implemented into another game which is Shooting Game.

The Shooting Game is implemented with SDL library. Once you enter the game window, you can use the keyboard to control the plane body and launch the bullet to get the scores. Also, the game will become harder if you get enough points from the targets.
